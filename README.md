## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To play or modify this game, you'll need a web browser and a code editor (if you plan to edit the code). No external libraries are required, making it easy to run by simply opening the HTML file.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MarineScape.git
   ```

### Controls

- **Keyboard**: Use the arrow keys (or any control scheme you implement) to move the jellyfish up, down, left, or right.

### Game Rules

- **Avoid obstacles**: Rocks will continuously appear from one side of the screen. Your goal is to avoid them by moving the jellyfish.
